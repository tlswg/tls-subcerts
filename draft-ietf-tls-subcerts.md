--- abstract

The organizational separation between operators of TLS and DTLS
endpoints and the certification authority can create limitations.  For
example, the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and the
algorithms they support are ultimately determined by the
certification authority.  This document describes a mechanism to
to overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to
delegate their own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking
compatibility with peers that do not support this specification.

# Introduction

Server operators often deploy (D)TLS termination services in locations such
as remote data centers or Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) where it may
be difficult to detect compromises of private key material corresponding
to TLS certificates.  Short-lived certificates may be
used to limit the exposure of keys in these cases.

However, short-lived certificates need to be renewed more frequently than
long-lived certificates.  If an external Certification Authority (CA) is unable to issue a certificate in
time to replace a deployed certificate, the server would no longer be able to
present a valid certificate to clients.  With short-lived certificates, there is
a smaller window of time to renew a certificates and therefore a higher risk that
an outage at a CA will negatively affect the uptime of the TLS-fronted service.

Typically, a (D)TLS server uses a certificate provided by some entity other than
the operator of the server (a CA) {{!RFC8446}}
{{!RFC5280}}.  This organizational separation makes the (D)TLS server operator
dependent on the CA for some aspects of its operations, for example:

* Whenever the server operator wants to deploy a new certificate, it has to
  interact with the CA.
* The CA might only issue credentials containing certain types of public key,
  which can limit the set of (D)TLS signature schemes usable by the server
  operator.

To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document specifies a limited delegation
mechanism that allows a (D)TLS peer to issue its own credentials within
the scope of a certificate issued by an external CA.  These credentials only enable the
recipient of the delegation to speak for names that the CA has authorized.  Furthermore,
this mechanism allows the server to use modern signature algorithms such as
Ed25519 {{?RFC8032}} even if their CA does not support them.

This document refers to the certificate issued by the CA as a "certificate",
or "delegation certificate", and the one issued by the operator as a "delegated
credential" or "DC".

# Solution Overview

A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with two semantic
fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with its associated
signature algorithm).  The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation
from the certificate that is issued to the peer.  The private key
used to sign a credential corresponds to the public key of the peer's
X.509 end-entity certificate {{RFC5280}}.

A (D)TLS handshake that uses delegated credentials differs from a standard handshake
in a few important ways:

* The initiating peer provides an extension in its ClientHello or CertificateRequest
  that indicates support for this mechanism.
* The peer sending the Certificate message provides both the certificate
  chain terminating in its certificate as well as the delegated credential.
* The initiator uses information from the peer's certificate
  to verify the delegated credential and that the peer is asserting an
  expected identity, determining an authentication result for the peer.
* Peers accepting the delegated credential use it as the certificate
  key for the (D)TLS handshake.

As detailed in {{delegated-credentials}}, the delegated credential is
cryptographically bound to the end-entity certificate with which the
credential may be used.  This document specifies the use of delegated
credentials in (D)TLS 1.3 or later; their use in prior versions of the
protocol is not allowed.

Delegated credentials allow a peer to terminate (D)TLS connections on behalf of
the certificate owner.  If a credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for
revoking it without revoking the certificate itself.  To limit exposure in case
of the compromise of a delegated credential's private key, delegated credentials
have a maximum validity period.  In the absence of an application profile standard
specifying otherwise, the maximum validity period is set to 7 days.  Peers MUST NOT issue credentials with a validity period longer than the maximum validity period or that extends beyond the validity period of the delegation certificate.
This mechanism is described in detail in {{client-and-server-behavior}}.

It was noted in [XPROT] that certificates in use by servers that
support outdated protocols such as SSLv2 can be used to forge
signatures for certificates that contain the keyEncipherment KeyUsage
({{RFC5280}} section 4.2.1.3).  In order to reduce the risk of cross-
protocol attacks on certificates that are not intended to be used
with DC-capable TLS stacks, we define a new DelegationUsage
extension to X.509 that permits use of delegated credentials.  (See {{certificate-requirements}}.)


## Rationale

Delegated credentials present a better alternative than other delegation
mechanisms like proxy certificates {{?RFC3820}} for several reasons:

* There is no change needed to certificate validation at the PKI layer.
* X.509 semantics are very rich.  This can cause unintended
  consequences if a service owner creates a proxy certificate where
  the properties differ from the leaf certificate.  Proxy certificates can
  be useful in controlled environments, but remain a risk in scenarios
  where the additional flexibility they provide is not necessary.  For
  this reason,  delegated credentials have very restricted semantics
  that should not conflict with X.509 semantics.
* Proxy certificates rely on the certificate path building process to establish
  a binding between the proxy certificate and the end-entity certificate.  Since
  the certificate path building process is not cryptographically protected, it is
  possible that a proxy certificate could be bound to another certificate with
  the same public key, with different X.509 parameters.  Delegated credentials,
  which rely on a cryptographic binding between the entire certificate and the
  delegated credential, cannot.
* Each delegated credential is bound to a specific signature algorithm for use
  in the (D)TLS handshake ({{RFC8446}} section 4.2.3).  This prevents
  them from being used with other, perhaps unintended, signature algorithms.
  The signature algorithm bound to the delegated credential can be chosen
  independently of the set of signature algorithms supported by the end-entity
  certificate.


## Related Work

Many of the use cases for delegated credentials can also be addressed using
purely server-side mechanisms that do not require changes to client behavior
(e.g., a PKCS#11 interface or a remote signing mechanism, [KEYLESS] being one
example).  These
mechanisms, however, incur per-transaction latency, since the front-end
server has to interact with a back-end server that holds a private key.  The
mechanism proposed in this document allows the delegation to be done
off-line, with no per-transaction latency.  The figure below compares the
message flows for these two mechanisms
with (D)TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}} {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}.


~~~~~~~~~~
Remote key signing:

Client            Front-End            Back-End
  |----ClientHello--->|                    |
  |<---ServerHello----|                    |
  |<---Certificate----|                    |
  |                   |<---remote sign---->|
  |<---CertVerify-----|                    |
  |        ...        |                    |


Delegated Credential:

Client            Front-End            Back-End
  |                   |<--DC distribution->|
  |----ClientHello--->|                    |
  |<---ServerHello----|                    |
  |<---Certificate----|                    |
  |<---CertVerify-----|                    |
  |        ...        |                    |
~~~~~~~~~~

These two mechanisms can be complementary.  A server could use
delegated credentials for clients that support them, while using a
server-side mechanism to support legacy clients.  Both mechanisms
require a trusted relationship between the Front-End and Back-End --
the delegated credential can be used in place of a certificate
private key.

Use of short-lived certificates with automated certificate issuance,
e.g., with Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) {{?RFC8555}},
reduces the risk of key compromise, but has several limitations.
Specifically, it introduces an operationally-critical dependency on an
external party (the CA).  It also
limits the types of algorithms supported for (D)TLS authentication to those
the CA is willing to issue a certificate for.  Nonetheless, existing
automated issuance APIs like ACME may be useful for provisioning delegated credentials.


# Delegated Credentials

While X.509 forbids end-entity certificates from being used as issuers for
other certificates, it is valid to use them to issue other signed
objects as long as the certificate contains the digitalSignature KeyUsage
({{RFC5280}} section 4.2.1.3).  (All certificates compatible with TLS 1.3 are
required to contain the digitalSignature KeyUsage.)  We define a new signed
object format that would encode only the semantics that are needed for this
application.  The Credential has the following structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     uint32 valid_time;
     SignatureScheme expected_cert_verify_algorithm;
     opaque ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;
   } Credential;
~~~~~~~~~~

valid_time:

: Time, in seconds relative to the delegation certificate's
  notBefore value, after which the delegated credential is no longer valid.
  Endpoints will reject delegated credentials that expire more than 7 days
  from the current time (as described in {{client-and-server-behavior}})
  based on the default (see {{solution-overview}}.

expected_cert_verify_algorithm:

: The signature algorithm of the Credential key pair, where the type
  SignatureScheme is as defined in {{RFC8446}}. This is expected to be
  the same as the sender's CertificateVerify.algorithm (as described in {{validating-a-delegated-credential}}).  Only signature
  algorithms allowed for use in CertificateVerify messages are allowed.  When
  using RSA, the public key MUST NOT use the rsaEncryption OID.  As a result,
  the following algorithms are not allowed for use with delegated credentials:
  rsa_pss_rsae_sha256, rsa_pss_rsae_sha384, rsa_pss_rsae_sha512.

ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo:

: The Credential's public key, a DER-encoded {{X.690}} SubjectPublicKeyInfo as defined in
{{RFC5280}}.

The DelegatedCredential has the following structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     Credential cred;
     SignatureScheme algorithm;
     opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
   } DelegatedCredential;
~~~~~~~~~~

cred:

: The Credential structure as previously defined.

algorithm:

: The signature algorithm used to verify DelegatedCredential.signature.

signature:

: The delegation, a signature that binds the credential to the end-entity
  certificate's public key as specified below. The signature scheme is specified
  by DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

The signature of the DelegatedCredential is computed over the concatenation of:

1. A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times.
2. The context string "TLS, server delegated credentials" for server authentication and "TLS, client delegated credentials" for client authentication.
3. A single 0 byte, which serves as the separator.
4. The DER-encoded X.509 end-entity certificate used to sign the
   DelegatedCredential.
5. DelegatedCredential.cred.
6. DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

The signature is computed by using the private key of the peer's end-entity
certificate, with the algorithm indicated by DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

The signature effectively binds the credential to the parameters of the
handshake in which it is used.  In particular, it ensures that credentials are
only used with the certificate and signature algorithm chosen by the
delegator.

The code changes required in order to create and verify delegated credentials,
and the implementation complexity this entails, are localized to the (D)TLS
stack.  This has the advantage of avoiding changes to the often-delicate
security-critical PKI code.

## Client and Server Behavior

This document defines the following (D)TLS extension code point.

~~~~~~~~~~
   enum {
     ...
     delegated_credential(34),
     (65535)
   } ExtensionType;
~~~~~~~~~~

### Server Authentication

A client which supports this specification SHALL send a
"delegated_credential" extension in its ClientHello. The body of the extension
consists of a SignatureSchemeList (defined in {{RFC8446}}):

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     SignatureScheme supported_signature_algorithm<2..2^16-2>;
   } SignatureSchemeList;
~~~~~~~~~~

If the client receives a delegated credential without having indicated support
in its ClientHello,
then the client MUST abort the handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.

If the extension is present, the server MAY send a delegated credential; if the
extension is not present, the server MUST NOT send a delegated credential.
The server MUST ignore the extension unless (D)TLS 1.3 or a later version is
negotiated.  An example of when a server could choose not to send a delegated
credential is when the SignatureSchemes listed only contain signature schemes
for which a corresponding delegated credential does not exist or are
otherwise unsuitable for the connection.

The server MUST send the delegated credential as an extension in the
CertificateEntry of its end-entity certificate; the client SHOULD ignore
delegated credentials sent as extensions to any other certificate.

The algorithm field MUST be of a type advertised by the client in the
"signature_algorithms" extension of the ClientHello message and
the expected_cert_verify_algorithm field MUST be of a
type advertised by the client in the SignatureSchemeList and is
considered invalid otherwise.  Clients that receive invalid delegated
credentials MUST terminate the connection with an "illegal_parameter"
alert.

### Client Authentication

A server that supports this specification SHALL send a
"delegated_credential" extension in the CertificateRequest message
when requesting client authentication.  The body of the
extension consists of a SignatureSchemeList.  If the server receives a
delegated credential without having indicated support in its
CertificateRequest, then the server MUST abort with an
"unexpected_message" alert.

If the extension is present, the client MAY send a delegated credential; if the
extension is not present, the client MUST NOT send a delegated credential.
The client MUST ignore the extension unless (D)TLS 1.3 or a later version is
negotiated.

The client MUST send the delegated credential as an extension in the
CertificateEntry of its end-entity certificate; the server SHOULD ignore
delegated credentials sent as extensions to any other certificate.

The algorithm field MUST be of a type advertised by the server
in the "signature_algorithms" extension of the CertificateRequest message
and the expected_cert_verify_algorithm field MUST be of a type
advertised by the server in the SignatureSchemeList
and is considered invalid otherwise.  Servers that receive invalid
delegated credentials MUST terminate the connection with an
"illegal_parameter" alert.

### Validating a Delegated Credential

On receiving a delegated credential and certificate chain, the peer validates
the certificate chain and matches the end-entity certificate to the peer's
expected identity in the same way that it is done when delegated credentials are
not in use. It then performs the following checks with expiry time set to the 
delegation certificate's notBefore value plus DelegatedCredential.cred.valid_time:

1. Verify that the current time is within the validity interval of the
   credential. This is done by asserting that the current time does not exceed
   the expiry time.  (The start time of the credential is implicitly validated
   as part of certificate validation.)
1. Verify that the delegated credential's remaining validity period is no more
   than the maximum validity period. This is done by asserting that the expiry
   time does not exceed the current time plus the maximum validity period (7
   days by default).
1. Verify that expected_cert_verify_algorithm matches
   the scheme indicated in the peer's CertificateVerify message and that the
   algorithm is allowed for use with delegated credentials.
1. Verify that the end-entity certificate satisfies the conditions in
   {{certificate-requirements}}.
1. Use the public key in the peer's end-entity certificate to verify the
   signature of the credential using the algorithm indicated by
   DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

If one or more of these checks fail, then the delegated credential is deemed
invalid.  Clients and servers that receive invalid delegated credentials MUST terminate the
connection with an "illegal_parameter" alert.

If successful, the participant receiving the Certificate message uses the public
key in DelegatedCredential.cred to verify the signature in the peer's
CertificateVerify message.

## Certificate Requirements

This document defines a new X.509 extension, DelegationUsage, to be used in the certificate
when the certificate permits the usage of delegated credentials.  What follows
is the ASN.1 {{X.680}} for the DelegationUsage certificate extension.

~~~~~~~~~~
    ext-delegationUsage EXTENSION  ::= {
        SYNTAX DelegationUsage IDENTIFIED BY id-pe-delegationUsage
    }

    DelegationUsage ::= NULL

    id-pe-delegationUsage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
        { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
          private(4) enterprise(1) id-cloudflare(44363) 44 }
~~~~~~~~~~

The extension MUST be marked non-critical.  (See Section 4.2 of {{RFC5280}}.)
An endpoint MUST NOT accept a delegated credential unless the peer's end-entity
certificate satisfies the following criteria:

* It has the DelegationUsage extension.
* It has the digitalSignature KeyUsage (see the KeyUsage extension defined in
  {{RFC5280}}).

A new extension was chosen instead of adding a new Extended Key Usage
(EKU) to be compatible with deployed (D)TLS and PKI software stacks
without requiring CAs to issue new intermediate certificates.


# Operational Considerations

The operational consideration documented in this section should be
taken into consideration when using Delegated Certificates.

## Client Clock Skew

One of the risks of deploying a short-lived credential system based
on absolute time is client clock skew.  If a client's clock is sufficiently
ahead or behind of the server's clock, then clients will reject delegated credentials
that are valid from the server's perspective.  Clock
skew also affects the validity of the original certificates.  The lifetime
of the delegated credential should be set taking clock skew into account.
Clock skew may affect a delegated credential at the beginning and end of
its validity periods, which should also be taken into account.


# IANA Considerations

This document registers the "delegated_credential" extension in the
"TLS ExtensionType Values" registry.  The "delegated_credential"
extension has been assigned a code point of 34.  The IANA registry
lists this extension as "Recommended" (i.e., "Y") and indicates that
it may appear in the ClientHello (CH), CertificateRequest (CR),
or Certificate (CT) messages in (D)TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}} {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}.
Additionally, the "DTLS-Only" column is assigned the value "N".

This document also defines an ASN.1 module for the DelegationUsage
certificate extension in {{module}}.  IANA has registered value 95 for
"id-mod-delegated-credential-extn" in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module
Identifier" (1.3.5.1.5.5.7.0) registry.  An OID for the DelegationUsage certificate extension
is not needed as it is already assigned to the extension from
Cloudflare's IANA Private Enterprise Number (PEN) arc.

# Security Considerations

The security consideration documented in this section should be
taken into consideration when using Delegated Certificates.

## Security of Delegated Credential's Private Key

Delegated credentials limit the exposure of the private key used in
a (D)TLS connection by limiting its validity period.  An attacker who
compromises the private key of a delegated credential can
impersonate the compromised party in new TLS connections until the
delegated credential expires.

However, they cannot create new delegated credentials.  Thus, delegated
credentials should not be used to send a delegation to an untrusted party, but
are meant to be used between parties that have some trust relationship with each
other.  The secrecy of the delegated credential's private key is thus important and
access control mechanisms SHOULD be used to protect it, including file system
controls, physical security, or hardware security modules.


## Re-use of Delegated Credentials in Multiple Contexts

It is not possible to use the same delegated credential for both client and server
authentication because issuing parties compute the corresponding signature using a context string unique to the intended role (client or server).


## Revocation of Delegated Credentials

Delegated credentials do not provide any additional form of early revocation.
Since it is short lived, the expiry of the delegated credential revokes
the credential.  Revocation of the long term private key that signs the
delegated credential (from the end-entity certificate) also implicitly revokes
the delegated credential.

## Interactions with Session Resumption

If a peer decides to cache the certificate chain and re-validate it
when resuming a connection, they SHOULD also cache the
associated delegated credential and re-validate it.  Failing to do so
may result in resuming connections for which the DC has expired.

## Privacy Considerations

Delegated credentials can be valid for 7 days (by default) and it is much easier for a
service to create delegated credentials than a certificate signed by a CA.  A
service could determine the client time and clock skew by creating several
delegated credentials with different expiry timestamps and observing whether the
client would accept it.  Client time could be unique and thus privacy sensitive
clients, such as browsers in incognito mode, who do not trust the service might
not want to advertise support for delegated credentials or limit the number of
probes that a server can perform.

## The Impact of Signature Forgery Attacks

Delegated credentials are only used in (D)TLS 1.3 connections. However, the certificate
that signs a delegated credential may be used in other contexts such as (D)TLS 1.2.
Using a certificate in multiple contexts opens up a potential cross-protocol
attack against delegated credentials in (D)TLS 1.3.

When (D)TLS 1.2 servers support RSA key exchange, they may be vulnerable to attacks
that allow forging an RSA signature over an arbitrary message [BLEI].
TLS 1.2 {{?RFC5246}} (Section 7.4.7.1.) describes a mitigation strategy requiring
careful implementation of timing resistant countermeasures for preventing these attacks.
Experience shows that in practice, server implementations may fail to fully
stop these attacks due to the complexity of this mitigation [ROBOT].
For (D)TLS 1.2 servers that support RSA key exchange using a DC-enabled end-entity
certificate, a hypothetical signature forgery attack would allow forging a
signature over a delegated credential.
The forged delegated credential could then be used by the attacker as the equivalent of a
man-in-the-middle certificate, valid for a maximum of 7 days (if the default
valid_time is used).

Server operators should therefore minimize the risk of using DC-enabled
end-entity certificates where a signature forgery oracle may be present.
If possible, server operators may choose to use DC-enabled certificates only for signing
credentials, and not for serving non-DC (D)TLS traffic.
Furthermore, server operators may use elliptic curve certificates for DC-enabled
traffic, while using RSA certificates without the DelegationUsage certificate
extension for non-DC traffic; this completely prevents such attacks.

Note that if a signature can be forged over an arbitrary credential, the
attacker can choose any value for the valid_time field.  Repeated signature
forgeries therefore allow the attacker to create multiple delegated
credentials that can cover the entire validity period of the
certificate.  Temporary exposure of the key or a signing oracle may
allow the attacker to impersonate a server for the lifetime of the certificate.
